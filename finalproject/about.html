    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Romira Global is a registered company in Angola focused on empowering artisans, 
    Founded in February 2024, <strong>ROMIRA GLOBAL</strong> was born out of a passion to make crochet
    more accessible, affordable, and inspiring for artisans across Angola. What began as a simple idea
    — to provide quality materials without compromise — has grown into a movement that empowers
    creativity and entrepreneurship.
  </p>
  <p>
    We believe that every stitch tells a story. Our mission is to supply hooks, yarns, and accessories
    that combine durability with affordability, ensuring that artisans can focus on their craft without
    worrying about cost or quality. By sourcing responsibly and designing with care, we bring products
    that meet international standards while honoring local traditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    ROMIRA GLOBAL is more than a supplier — we are a community builder. We exist to uplift Angolan
    artisans, helping them transform their skills into sustainable businesses. Whether you are creating
    a baby blanket, a market bag, or a decorative wall hanging, our materials are here to support your
    vision and bring it to life.
  </p>
  <p>
    With every product we deliver, we carry forward our promise: <em>to empower creativity, nurture
    culture, and make crochet a thriving part of Angola’s future.</em>
